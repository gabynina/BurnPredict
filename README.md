# Mental Health Within The Office
Creators: Gabriella Nina, Angelina Chirichella and Sam Alcosser

The virtual nature of individual’s 
jobs during the Covid-19 Pandemic has 
deteriorated employee mental health, 
calling for better employer communication. 
We propose to make it mandatory for 
businesses to administer weekly or bi-weekly 
surveys to their employees. These surveys will 
check in with employee’s mental health and 
‘burnout’ state and  then convey this 
information to the employer.
